manybabies_merged.csv is the main dataset containing all looking-time trials and serves as the starting point for your analyses. To clarify the meaning of each variable in this file, a separate document, manybabies_merged_data_dictionary.pdf, is provided.

The manybabies_merged.csv file was generated by homogenizing and merging data from the ManyBabies 1, 3, and 4 projects. All cleaning, harmonization, and merging steps are fully documented in ManyBabies Data Processing.qmd. A high-level overview of this pipeline, along with brief summaries of MB1, MB3, and MB4, is included in ManyBabies Data Processing Overview.pdf.

The Original Data Files folder contains the unmodified source datasets (MB1, MB3, MB4) used to create the merged file. When ManyBabies Data Processing.qmd is executed, it reads these originals and produces manybabies_merged.csv as output. ManyBabies Data Processing.html is the rendered HTML version of that processing script.

The file manybabies_validation.xlsx contains a manual validation check conducted after merging. For each original dataset (MB1, MB3, MB4), 10 participants were randomly selected, and we verified whether they appeared correctly in the merged dataset. When participants were absent, we checked whether their exclusion was justified based on the documented exclusion criteria.
